# Teaching-Assistant-Evaluation-

This Project is designed to use machine learning to predict the scores of TA

Data retrieved from UCI Machine Learning Repository: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/teaching+assistant+evaluation

Used generalized linear mixed model and lasso regression model to determine the significance of 5 factors

## Introduction

This study will be mainly focused on the the factors that influence the teaching assistant evaluation from
University of Wisconsin-Madison, and the dataset used in this study is provided by Wei-Yin Loh and
Tjen-Sien Lim (Department of Statistics, University of Wisconsin-Madison) on the UCI Machine Learning
Repository. The dataset consists of evaluations of teaching performance over three regular semesters and
two summer semesters of 151 teaching assistants at the Statistics Department of the University of
Wisconsin-Madison.
